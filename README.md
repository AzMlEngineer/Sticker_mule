In this project, i showed how to use PyTorch for generative learning. I used an unsupervised approach in which the data is not labeled. I trained a GAN to generate images similar to the training images used in the 
Fashion-MNIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST is a popular academic dataset used for image classification that includes images of articles of clothing. We accessed the Fashion-MNIST data to get an idea of what these
images look like, and then created some synthetic images based on what weâ€™ve seen.
